# [timur-eslint-config](https://www.npmjs.com/package/timur-eslint-config)

My personal opinionated preference eslint config that can be written into any project with a simple command. prettier-eslint-cli is also installed as a dev dependency. It's used for JavaScript, React, and React Native projects

## install as a global dependency

```
npm i -g timur-eslint-config
```

## Usage

Go into any project directory where you want this eslint config. Next run 
```
timur-eslint-config
```
